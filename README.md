# rest-api

This is a REST API application built with Express and Vue.js, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on a list of contacts stored in memory. The server exposes four endpoints: GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT. The client-side communicates with the server-side using HTTP requests, and the responses are displayed to the user using Vue.js components.
